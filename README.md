# Household displacement in recent US disasters

This repository houses code for a simple dashboard that visualizes data from the [United States Household Pulse Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey.html). The trends of property damage and of displacement duration can be compared against a range of other factors (e.g., demographics, housing considerations, mental health). The dashboard is a companion to an open access article proposing predictive models to capture household displacement and return after disasters:
